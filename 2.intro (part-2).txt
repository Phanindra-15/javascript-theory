                 ---------------------------------



1.JS is a OBPS (Object based programming language)

2.****	POPs(project oriented programming language)   ex:c language

3. ***        OBPS    (this will not support inheritance  nd dynamic polymorphism                     concept )
                   eg:  javascript, VB in .net programming

4. *** OOPS
                      -->REQUIRED MORE MEMORY
                      -->eg: java ,.net etc..

5.JAVASCRIPT :----- a.It is a interpreted programming language   
                                     b.browsers provide intepreter
                                     c.it is client side cript used in web development to handle client                                               side intercation and validation
                                     d.it is a programming language


WORKING:

        --->   fORM dETAILS    -->    JAVA  ------------>DATABASE

DRAWBACKS:-
------------------
1.Js is not safe as the code is exposed to client from browser
2. js can be blocked by browser


                         javascript BOM AND DOM
                         ===========================

->  JS BOM(BROWSER OBJECT MODEL) provides collecion of objects that are used      to handle browser eg:location ,history, navigation

->js DOM(DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL) that are used to handle the documents     elements  eg::forms ,images
